# DeskSave
This application is able to move your files from your desktop or download folder to your Documents and structures them according to the data-type. 

## What is the DeskSave capable of?
- **Graphical User Interface**: The application is run trough an GUI.
- **JSON configuration file**: `\script\file_types.json` contains all of the file-types that are being recognised by the application.
- **CI/CD**: This repository contains an CI/CD pipeline that checks if all of its python code is being correct via *Pylint*.

## `\script`
The python script and the JSON file lie in this directory.
### Files
- `deskSave.py`: Python Script with file-moving logic.
- `file_types.json`: JSON File with all file types. You can add additional file types.

## Roadmap for DeskSave
### Currently in development
- **Executable File**: Launch DeskSave via one executable file.

### Planned updates
- **Select directory**: The user should be able to Source- and Destination Folder.
- **Settings**: The user should be able to change the Settings of the application in the GUI.
